# Loan_Default_Prediction
The objective of the problem is to pick out which customer will be able to pay the debt and which customer is likely will not be able to pay the debts. Clearly we have to create a classification model here. We have to use algorithms like logistic regression, decision tree or random forest. We need to create a model that is accurate and the error percentage should be less. The main objective of this project is to predict whether assigning the loan to particular person will be safe or not. ... In this paper we are predict the loan data by using some machine learning algorithms they are classification, logic regression, Decision Tree and gradient boosting.   ❑ A classification model is run on data attempting to classify whether the person or client is eligible for get loan from any bank with good accuracy of statement.   ❑ Our objectives included some points about this Loan Status Prediction
